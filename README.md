# Signify
Translating sign language to speech through your computer camera!


HOW TO WORK:

run interpreter.py, which will track your hands.
Type the name of a word you want to teach to the machine learner into the console and press enter
hit space to start recording an action, hit space again to end the recording.
Once you've recorded everything, then you close out of the interpreter by pressing escape
Run the model generator file
Then you can go back into the interpreter file and it will detect when you make one of the motions you made!
The more you teach the learner, the more precise it is. That means more repetitions of one movement and more movements in general.

This is based off of motion. Still letters or patterns will not register.
